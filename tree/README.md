# naos-tree

**The [Networked Artifacts Operating System](https://github.com/shiftr-io/naos) build tree.**

You can use this build tree to easily build a project that uses the naos component, but using the [naos](https://github.com/shiftr-io/naos) command line utility is recommended.

## Usage

1. Download the xtensa toolchain (check `toolchain.version`)
2. Add the toolchain `bin` directory to your `PATH` env variable.
3. Link the source directory to the `main/src/` directory.
4. Run `make` and other commands in the build tree.
